# 🩹 Anki Patcher

= modular python script launcher to patch anki cards en masse

## Basic Idea

Anki patcher is a script launcher to manipulate anki cards via patch `operations` defined as python functions.

An operation is a python file with an `execute (card_id, fields, config)` function. This function gets called for each card of a specified deck and can execute arbitrary code on the card. The `card_id` and `fields` are provided by anki pacher and the `config` is a parsed .yml file provided by the user.

## Setup

- Option A (local dev):
  - run `poetry install`
  - run `poetry shell` and `python -m unidic download` to download the unidic dictionary
  - add an .env file to the root of the project (based on .env.example)
- Option B (Docker, no local Python required):
  - ensure the AnkiConnect add-on is installed and your Anki Desktop app is running (defaults to http://localhost:8765)
  - Docker will reach your host's AnkiConnect via `http://host.docker.internal:8765` (pre-configured)

## Available commands

To execute an operation locally, run `poetry run anki-patcher <--flags> <command>`

- `poetry run anki-patcher list`: lists all available patch operations
- `poetry run anki-patcher patch -o <operation> -d <deck-name> -c <path-to-config.yml> `: executes the specified operation on all cards of the deck

## Running with Docker

No need to install Python or Poetry. The container image includes all dependencies and downloads `unidic` at build time.

Quickstart with docker compose (recommended):

```
# List available operations
docker compose run --rm anki-patcher list

# Run an operation (example: gpt)
docker compose run --rm \
  -e OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key \
  anki-patcher patch -o gpt -d "Your::Deck" -c /work/example_configs/gpt_example.yml
```

Notes:

- Anki must be running on your Mac with the AnkiConnect add-on enabled.
- The container uses `ANKI_CONNECT_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8765` by default so it can call your host's AnkiConnect.
- Mount your configs via the provided `docker-compose.yml`. By default, `./configs` and `./example_configs` are available at `/work/configs` and `/work/example_configs`.
- Stock media operations (`add_image`, `add_tts`) store files via AnkiConnect (`storeMediaFile`), so they work from Docker without mounting your `collection.media`.
- If a custom operation writes media files directly, set `ANKI_MEDIA_FOLDER` to a valid path reachable from the container and mount it. Two options:
  1. Pass your host path directly (read/write): `-e ANKI_MEDIA_FOLDER="/absolute/host/path/to/collection.media"` and mount that path into the container at the same location using `volumes:`.
  2. Or mount into the container at `/anki_media` and set `-e ANKI_MEDIA_FOLDER=/anki_media`.

Example with media mount (only needed for custom operations that write directly to the media folder):

```
docker compose run --rm \
  -e ANKI_MEDIA_FOLDER=/anki_media \
  -v "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Anki2/User 1/collection.media":/anki_media:rw \
  anki-patcher patch -o add_image -d "German::A1" -c /work/example_configs/add_image_example.yml
```

Optional environment variables:

- OPENROUTER_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY (for `gpt` op)
- OPENAI_API_BASE (defaults to https://openrouter.ai/api/v1)
- GOOGLE_API_KEY and CX (for `add_image` op)

### Stock operations:

- `add_image`: for each card of a deck, adds an image retrieved from google, based on another card field value ([example config](./example_configs/add_image_example.yml))
  - use-case: add images to cards for language learning
  - example-use: `poetry run anki-patcher patch -o add_image -d "German::A1" -c example_configs/add_image_example.yml`
- `add_tts`: for each card of a deck, adds a text-to-speech audio file retrieved from google tts, based on another card field value ([example config](./example_configs/add_tts_example.yml))
  - use-case: add tts to cards for language learning
  - example-use: `poetry run anki-patcher patch -o add_tts -d "German::A1" -c example_configs/add_tts_example.yml`
- `gpt`: for each card of a deck, adds a text generated by an OpenAI-compatible API (defaults to OpenRouter; e.g., openai/gpt-5), based on another card field value ([example config](./example_configs/gpt_example.yml))
  - use-case: add example sentences to cards
  - example-use: `poetry run anki-patcher patch -o gpt -d "German::A1" -c example_configs/gpt_example.yml`
  - env: set OPENROUTER_API_KEY (preferred) or OPENAI_API_KEY; optionally override OPENAI_API_BASE (defaults to https://openrouter.ai/api/v1)
- `replace`: for each card of a deck, replaces a substring of a field value with another string ([example config](./example_configs/replace_example.yml))
  - use-case: replace a substring of a field value with another string
  - example-use: `poetry run anki-patcher patch -o replace -d "German::A1" -c example_configs/replace_example.yml`

## Building your own operations

It's easy!
Just create a new file in [operations](anki_patcher/patcher/operations/) with a `execute(card_id, fields, config)` function (see [add_image](anki_patcher/patcher/operations/add_image.py) for an example). Afterwards, the operation will be available to be executed via `poetry run anki-patcher patch -o <operation> -d <deck-name> -c <path-to-config.yml> `. To check if your operation is available, run `poetry run anki-patcher list`.
